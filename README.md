## General Info
Qwixx is a popular luck and strategy dice game played between 2 to 4 players. On this version I created a single version of the game using javaScript. The rules for the game can be found at https://www.ultraboardgames.com/qwixx/game-rules.php

## Features
This app allows you to play the game of Qwixx as a single player and incorporates all of the game rules(such as scoring, when a player can roll, handling the game state, when a player must take a penalty score, what scores are allowed, and when the game ends).

## Technologies
The app was created with the following technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* javaScript

## What I Learned
This project turned out to be much more difficult than I had anticipated. My knowledge of javaScript greatly improved when working on this project as I had to learn and use things like javaScript Classes and handling modules. I also learned how important it is to organize and structure the code so that the functions and methods are able to work together to make the game work.

Upon completing this project, I was glad that I got it to work, however I felt that in order for one to truly enjoy the game, it needed to ne played by multiple players. So I am currently working on a multiplayer version of this game.
